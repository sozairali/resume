## PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
Product management and strategy leader at the intersection of data, AI, and global operations. I compress the product-market-fit (PMF) loop—customer discovery, quantitative validation, rapid prototyping, UX/onboarding, and lean go-to-market (GTM). Pedigree includes Stanford GSB (MBA), Harvard Kennedy School (MPA/ID), and Wharton (BS). Led cross-functional teams across engineering, design, data, and ops; launched and scaled programs in 11+ countries; invested in and supported category-leading startups. Quantitative background in econometrics, A/B testing, and funnel analytics; technical fluency in Python, SQL, and probabilistic data structures (Bloom, HyperLogLog).

## EXPERIENCE

### Co-Founder / Product & Operations — [eKai](https://ekai.ai)(AI / Data Analytics)
Remote (U.S.) • 2024–Present
- Owned end-to-end product management from discovery to MVP launch; defined roadmap, PRDs, and success metrics for data/AI workflows.
- Led structured interviews and JTBD synthesis; redesigned onboarding with guided “agent” flow to increase independent completion (testing >90% completion; demo→onboarding sign-ups >95%).
- Prototyped probabilistic sketching (Bloom baseline; adopted HyperLogLog for speed/accuracy-per-byte) to enable high-throughput distinct counts and telemetry for FK–PK recommendations.
- Ran small-N GTM experiments (events, outbound, partner demos); built funnel tracker with reply, meeting, and CAC proxy metrics; codified keep/kill/iterate decisions for PMF.
- Built early sales-readiness and ops stack (banking, HRIS/payroll, accounting, compliance) to reduce founder toil and accelerate enterprise readiness.
- Accepted into **Snowflake Startup Accelerator (2025)** and **C10 – MIT-affiliated AI-first accelerator (2024)**

### Global Head of Investments & New Ventures — Rayn
Remote • 2021–2024
- Incubated and led new ventures; **worked on the eKai technology platform starting in 2022** (prior to company launch in 2024): scoped technical feasibility, wrote product briefs, defined MVP, and partnered with engineering on prototypes and benchmarks.
- Built product narratives and investor materials; evaluated PMF risk, pricing, and initial GTM; supported U.S. strategy and cross-functional hiring.
- Advised portfolio companies across sectors (fintech, logistics, education, AI) on experimentation frameworks, KPIs, onboarding, and founder-led GTM.

### Co-Founder & COO / Advisor — [Alter Global](https://alter.vc)
San Francisco, Boston, and international • 2016–2020; Advisor 2021–Present
- Launched operations across **11+ countries**; localized GTM, talent, HR, finance, and compliance; managed distributed cross-functional teams across time zones.
- Sourced and supported early-stage investments; worked with founders who became category leaders in multiple markets.
- Built repeatable operating playbooks and founder readiness programs; coached CEOs on customer discovery, recruiting, and investor communications.

### Earlier Roles (Selected)
State Bank of Pakistan • Consultant, Dalberg • Government of Albania (Harvard CID) • BMA Capital  
- Time-series forecasting models for macroeconomic indicators; strategy, market design, and analytics for public- and private-sector initiatives

## SELECTED ACHIEVEMENTS
- **PMF Loop Compression:** Designed and executed discovery→prototype→GTM loops for data/AI product; instrumented funnels and A/B style tests to prioritize features and reduce time-to-insight.
- **Onboarding & Activation:** “Onboarding agent” concept and UX flow increased independent completion in testing (>90%) and maintained high demo→onboarding conversion (>95%).
- **Probabilistic Data Structures:** Implemented Bloom filter baseline and migrated to HyperLogLog for distinct counting; achieved lower memory footprint and higher throughput to meet strict latency SLAs.
- **GTM Learning Under Small-N:** Built channel experiment log (events, LinkedIn outbound, partners); identified compliance- and infra-led messaging as highest signal; created CAC proxy to prioritize spend.
- **Global Operator:** Stood up back-office and compliance rails across 11+ markets; reduced operational risk and accelerated enterprise sales cycles.
- **Investor & Executive Narrative:** Developed evidence-based stories linking technical benchmarks and UX outcomes to business value; supported fundraising and partner diligence.

## EDUCATION
- **Stanford Graduate School of Business** — MBA  
- **Harvard Kennedy School** — MPA/ID (Econometrics, Development Economics)  
- **University of Pennsylvania, Wharton School** — BS Information Systems, Minors in Mathematics, Economics, Psychology; Magna Cum Laude

## TECHNICAL SKILLS
Python • SQL • Pandas • Scikit-learn (applied) • Git • Jupyter • Probabilistic Data Structures • Experimentation & Small-N A/B Testing • Analytics

## PROJECTS / ARTIFACTS
- **Probabilistic Sketching Module:** Bloom vs. HLL benchmark and adoption rationale; supports high-QPS distinct counts and mergeable telemetry for joins.
- **GTM Funnel Tracker:** Inputs/outputs across channels with conversion and CAC proxy; keep/kill/iterate framework for PMF.
- **UX Onboarding Case:** JTBD synthesis and guided flow leading to higher activation in tests.
- **Back-Office Launch Kit:** Repeatable setup for cards, HRIS/payroll, accounting, benefits, and SOC 2 readiness across multiple geographies.

## ADDITIONAL
Cross-functional leadership • Remote and distributed team management • Public speaking and workshops (data/AI product strategy)

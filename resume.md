## PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY
Product and strategy leader for data/AI who compresses the PMF + GTM loop (discovery -> quantitative validation -> prototyping -> UX/onboarding -> lean GTM).  
Led cross-functional teams, launched in 11+ countries, and supported category-leading founders and investments.  
Pedigree: Stanford GSB (MBA), Harvard (MPA/ID), Wharton (BS). Accelerator traction: Snowflake Startup Accelerator (2025) and C10 Labs, an MIT-affiliated AI-first accelerator (2024).

## CORE SKILLS
PMF • Customer discovery • JTBD • Rapid prototyping • Onboarding/activation • A/B testing (small-N) • Python • LangChain/LLMs • Probabilistic DS (HLL subset filter, Bloom) • GTM experiments • Cross-functional leadership • Global ops

## EXPERIENCE

### Co-Founder — Product, GTM, Operations & Fundraising — [eKai](https://ekai.ai) (https://ekai.ai)
Cambridge, MA (U.S.) • 2024 – Present
- User discovery -> UX: Ran structured interviews and JTBD synthesis; shipped guided "onboarding agent" flow -> >90% independent completion in testing and >95% demo->onboarding sign-ups.
- Data sketches: Built **Bloom filter** baseline; adopted **HyperLogLog** for a **probabilistic subset filter** to enable fast recommendation checks under latency and memory constraints.
- GTM experiments: Ran small-N sprints (events, outbound, partners); built funnel tracker (reply %, meetings, CAC proxy); codified keep/kill/iterate decisions to accelerate PMF learning.
- Fundraising: Raised **$300K** pre-seed; built data room and evidence-based investor narrative.
- Ops: Implemented banking, HRIS/payroll, accounting, and compliance -> reduced founder ops time from ~8–10 hrs/wk to ~1 hr/wk.
- Traction: **4 enterprise pilots**; accepted into **Snowflake Startup Accelerator (2025)** and **C10** (MIT-affiliated AI accelerator, **2024**).

### Global Head of Investments & New Ventures — Rayn
Remote • 2021 – 2023
- Incubated and invested in new ventures; **worked on the eKai technology platform starting in 2022** (prior to 2024 launch): scoped feasibility, defined MVP, and partnered with engineering/design on prototypes.
- Built product narratives and investor materials; laid PMF metrics (paid conversions), pricing, and initial GTM; led U.S. strategy and cross-functional hiring.
- Advised portfolio across fintech, logistics, education, and AI on experimentation frameworks, KPIs, onboarding, and founder-led GTM.

### Co-Founder & COO / Advisor — [Alter Global](https://alter.vc) (https://alter.vc)
San Francisco, Cambridge, and international • 2016 – 2020; Advisor 2021 – Present
- Launched operations in **11+ countries**; authored GTM/HR/finance/compliance playbooks; managed distributed cross-functional teams across time zones.
- Sourced and supported early-stage investments; supported fundraising efforts as the organization raised **~$17M** during tenure.
- Early backer for founders who became category leaders (e.g., Bazaar, Kargo)

### Earlier Roles (Selected)
Central Bank of Pakistan; Consultant, Dalberg; Government of Albania (Harvard CID); BMA Capital  
- Built time-series forecasting models for macro indicators; delivered strategy, market design, and analytics for public- and private-sector initiatives.

## SELECTED ACHIEVEMENTS
- **PMF loop compression:** Discovery -> prototype -> GTM with instrumented funnels and A/B-style tests to prioritize features and cut time-to-signal.
- **Activation:** "Onboarding agent" UX drove >90% independent completion (test) and >95% demo->onboarding sign-ups.
- **Probabilistic subset checks:** Bloom -> **HLL** adoption for **subset filtering** supporting recommendation checks at high throughput.
- **GTM under small-N:** Channel log (events, outbound, partners) identified highest-signal messaging; CAC proxy guided spend and focus.
- **Global operations:** Back office and compliance rails in 11+ markets increased speed of product feedback cycles.
- **Fundraising & narrative:** 100+ investor meetings; closed **$300K** pre-seed at eKai; supported **~$17M** raised at Alter Global with evidence-based storytelling.

## EDUCATION
- **Stanford Graduate School of Business** — MBA (incl. Big Data coursework) • Jun 2016
- **Harvard Kennedy School** — MPA/ID (Econometrics, Development Economics) • Jun 2016
- **University of Pennsylvania, Wharton School** — BS in Information Management, Finance; minors in Mathematics, Economics, Psychology), Magna Cum Laude • May 2010

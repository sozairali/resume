## 🧠 Summary

I'm a global product and operations leader with deep experience launching, scaling, and investing in startups across 11+ countries and multiple sectors. I specialize in early-stage product loops: structured user discovery, quantitative funnel testing, and building toward product-market fit (PMF). Trained at **Stanford GSB**, **Harvard**, and **Wharton**, I blend statistical rigor with entrepreneurial urgency to help ideas ship, grow, and compound.

I’ve led cross-functional teams across product, data, engineering, and ops; built back-office systems; launched GTM experiments; and translated between execs, engineers, and investors.

My superpower: compressing the idea-to-impact cycle from idea to prototype to product launch.

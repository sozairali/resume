# Back-Office Launch Kit (USA + Remote Contractors)

**Goal.** Stand up finance, HR, payroll, benefits, and bookkeeping in < 2 weeks so I spend < 1 hr/week on back-office tasks.

---

## 1 ▪ Banking & Cards

| Need | Vendor | Why | Watch-outs |
|------|--------|-----|------------|
| Operating account | **Brex** or **Mercury** | Startup-friendly, fast ACH/wires, no monthly fees | May not issue phyiscal checks if that's a need |
| Prestige option | JPMorgan | Name recognition | Heavy paperwork, slow support, **does not issue cards without significant funding/traction** → **not recommended** for preseed-stage |

**Setup time:** < 2 hours (Brex/Mercury)  
**Tip:** Connect bank feeds to accounting tool immediately.

---

## 2 ▪ Corporate Credit Card

| Vendor | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Brex Card** | Instant virtual/physical cards, spend controls, rewards | Requires linked Brex account or min. balance |

Consider issuing separate cards for SaaS vs. ad spend → easier reconciliation.

## 3 ▪ HR & Payroll

| Vendor | Pros | Cons |
|--------|------|------|
| **Rippling** | Handles US payroll tax filings, W-2s; also supports foreign contractors (consultant contracts & EOR) | Premium pricing |

**Takeaway**: Consider only if there are foregin contractors. Otherwise, Gusto or other options.

**Setup checklist**  
- Add founder + first employee (needed for benefits)  
- Connect bank for payroll pulls  
- Upload contractor agreements
- Create offer letter and other templates
- Distribute templates to employees + contractors

**Tip:** Make sure there's enough time for the first payroll since it's a manual ACH pull

## 4 ▪ Benefits

| Benefit | How we did it | Note |
|---------|---------------|------|
| Health | Through **Rippling** broker marketplace | Need ≥ 1 employee + founder to qualify; not many options available and pricing is quite fixed |
| 401(k) | Explored vendors; deferred | Re-visit post-Series A |

**Tip:** Also consider setting up QSEHRA for employees. Downside: Employees have to pay some part out of pocket. Recommended if employees have health insurance through spouse/parents, because QSEHRA can be used for other eligible expenses.

## 5 ▪ Accounting & Bookkeeping

| Tool | Reason | Task |
|------|--------|------|
| **QuickBooks Online** | Ubiquitous; integrates with Brex & bank feeds; almost all CPAs are familiar with it | Chart of accounts, invoices, reconciliations |
| (Alt) Xero | Fine, less common in US, harder to find CPA who works with Xero | — |

**Bookkeeper cadence:** part-time, **quarterly** reconciliations.  

**Setup**:
- Give read-only access to bank + Brex + Rippling.
- Work with bookkeeper to understand expense categorization and rationale

## 8 ▪ Lessons

1. **Link feeds on day 1**: automatic bank/card feeds reduce reconciliation pain.  
2. **Single vendor for HR+payroll+benefits+remote contracotrs** saves coordination overhead despite higher per-seat cost.  
3. **Track subscription ownership** up front → avoids audit scramble.
